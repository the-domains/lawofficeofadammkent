  At-Will Employment in California - The general rule in California is that you
  are an at-will

  employee and your employer can decline employment, fire, demote, fail to

  promote, reduce hours, change schedules or do any other adverse employment

  action for any reason whatsoever.They

  are allowed to take these actions based on false information, they can be

  unfair, they can do so without having any reason at all.The only time it is
  illegal is if the action

  is taken because of the employee's membership in a protected class (race,

  gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability, national origin, pregnancy)

  or because of their engagement in a legally protected activity such as acting

  as a witness in a case against the company, filing a wage complaint, or using

  Family Medical Leave to which you are entitled.
