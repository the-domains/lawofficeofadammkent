            <description><![CDATA[<p>At-Will Employment in California - The general rule in California is that you are an at-will
employee and your employer can decline employment, fire, demote, fail to
promote, reduce hours, change schedules or do any other adverse employment
action for any reason whatsoever.They
are allowed to take these actions based on false information, they can be
unfair, they can do so without having any reason at all.The only time it is illegal is if the action
is taken because of the employee's membership in a protected class (race,
gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability, national origin, pregnancy)
or because of their engagement in a legally protected activity such as acting
as a witness in a case against the company, filing a wage complaint, or using
Family Medical Leave to which you are entitled.</p>]]></description>
